# OctoPrint-ResumePrint

This plugin allows the user to pause and/or stop any job print and then resume it from the same point in which the job was stopped. It is a useful way to manage any failure situation where the print job gets suddenly stopped, as it avoids to spoil it by enabling to resume without any impact.
